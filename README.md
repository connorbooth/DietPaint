# DietPaint
This program emulates some of the basic features of a drawing program, allowing one to draw curves, lines, boxes, et cetera.
The user can save and load bitmaps, and they can draw with a number of colors, with a range of pen sizes.

The purpose of this personal project is satisfy an interest in learning GUI programming.
I use the WxWidgets library for the GUI elements, as it is supported on most Operating Systems through its use of 
native OS function calls to display "widgets".
